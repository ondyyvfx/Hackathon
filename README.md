# 🚀 Hackathon 2024 — 🥇 1st Place Winner

This is my project for **Hackathon 2024**, where I proudly secured **1st place**!  
The challenge was to create something in a **space theme**, and I focused mainly on **front-end development**.

---

## 🌌 Project Description

The main goal of the hackathon was to develop a creative and technically impressive project with a **cosmic/space vibe**. I built a fully front-end based interactive website using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

### 💡 Features:
- ✨ **Preloader** with a space animation
- 🪐 **Interactive Solar System** on the main page:
  - Hover over planets to reveal their names
  - Clean, minimal UI inspired by outer space

This project was built from scratch without using any front-end frameworks — just **pure JavaScript**.
